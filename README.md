# Monitoring Remote Patient EKG Readings with MQTT 

In this exercise, you will use the interoperability tools built into InterSystems IRIS for Healthâ„¢ to construct a basic user portal that monitors live EKG readings from a set of remote patients. See how you can use a minimal amount of code to quickly take real-time data coming from an MQTT broker, then save and display it on a dashboard.

Instructions for this exercise are available on the [InterSystems Learning site](https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=MonitoringMQTT).

If you would like to skip the exercise and view the completed application on your instance: Launch the lab in the exercise > navigate to Interoperability > List > Productions in the Management Portal, select Solution.MQTT, and click Open. Then, in the Production Configuration window, click Start.
